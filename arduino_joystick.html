					<p class="bem">Arduino USB Arcade Joystick</p>

					<p>I wanted to put together a chunky, arcade style digital joystick to use 
					when playing retro-games (mostly Atari ST vintage) on the PC.</p>

					<p>I chose to use an Arduino Leonardo due to the built-in USB Human Interface 
					Device (HID) capabilities. I already had a spare arcade stick from building my 
					own arcade cabinet so I just had to source a couple of arcade buttons and a 
					suitably sized plastic enclosure from Ebay.</p>

					<p>I used a 28mm hole saw to mount the buttons and stick in the case which 
					seems to be the standard size for most arcade components.</p>

					<p>The Arduino is wired to the buttons and stick as follows:</p>

					<p>Button 1 -> Arduino Pin 6<br>
					Button 2 -> Arduino Pin 7<br>
					Joystick Left -> Arduino Pin 8<br>
					Joystick Up -> Arduino Pin 9<br>
					Joystick Right -> Arduino Pin 10<br>
					Joystick Down -> Arduino Pin 11</p>

					<p>These connections can be changed as required if you also update the Arduino 
					sketch accordingly.</p>

					<p>Each button and each joystick axis also need to be connected to the Arduino 
					GND pin. The arcade buttons that I have each have 3 connectors so you may need 
					to use a meter to test which two of the connections are closed when the button is 
					pressed.</p>

					<p>To use an Arduino Leonardo as a USB game controller requires modified versions 
					of the Arduino libraries, HID.cpp and USBAPI.h which can be found at 
					<a href="http://www.imaginaryindustries.com/blog/?p=80">www.imaginaryindustries.com</a>. 
					The simple installation requirements are shown on that page. Thanks to Peter Barrett 
					for releasing the code. Note that you should change those files back to the original 
					Arduino versions once you have finished with your joystick and uploaded the sketch to it.</p>

					<p>My Arduino sketch is available to download from 
					<a href="https://github.com/devonshire/arduino-joystick">GitHub</a>. See the 
					<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage">Arduino Getting Started</a> pages 
					if you are new to Arduino.</p></p>
