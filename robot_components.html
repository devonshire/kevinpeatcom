				<div class="span6">
					<p class="bem">DFRobot Pirate Chassis</p>
					<p>I chose this chassis as I wanted a stable base that I could add extra hardware to at a 
					later date but one of the smaller and cheaper 3-wheeled chassis on the market would do 
					just as well or you could obviously build your own. I bought the chassis from an Ebay 
					vendor but it is also available from the <a href="http://www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=97#.UReUCSBn6qs">
					DFRobot website</a>. The chassis will be powered by 5 x AA 3800mAh Ni-MH rechargeable 
					batteries, although any similar cells would be suitable.</p>

				<div class="span6">
					<p class="bem">Arduino Mega 2560 V3</p>
					<p>These are available from a number of specialty electronics sites and from 
					numerous Ebay vendors. I had originally intended to use the smaller and cheaper Arduino 
					Uno but decided that the extra interfacing capabilities of the Mega would be useful
					for the project. The Arduino will be powered by a 9V PP3 300mAh Ni-MH rechargeable 
					battery separate from the batteries used to power the chassis.</p>
					<p>I gave some thought to using a Raspberry Pi for the project but without a breakout 
					board the Pi has fairly limited interfacing capabilities plus also draws more power. There 
					are also many cheap sensors and other components available for Arduino with code libraries 
					being freely available.</p>

					<p class="bem">L298N Motor Shield</p>
					<p>This motor shield is required to control two sets of electric motors. There are several 
					different types of Arduino motor shields available often with slightly different connections. 
					I purchased the model to the right from an Ebay vendor.</p>

				<div class="span6">
					<p class="bem">HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor</p>
					<p>These are available cheaply from Ebay suppliers. There are a couple of different versions 
					available but they appear to have the same connections.</p>

				<div class="span6">
					<p class="bem">Standard 16x2 Character LCD Screen</p>
					<p>I used a standard monochrome backlit screen which are available from a number of online 
					suppliers. They usually come with a separate 16 pin header which much be soldered to the 
					circuit board which can be a little fiddly if your soldering skills are anything like mine.</p>

				<div class="span6">
					<p class="bem">Infra-red Sensors</p>
					<p>I bought two pairs of the sensors to the right from an Ebay vendor. They are fairly cheap 
					and easy to get working but could potentially be upgraded to better ones in the future.</p>

					<p class="bem">MMA7361 Three Axis Accelerometer</p>
					<p>This was also a cheap purchase from an Ebay vendor. It was supplied with a 10 pin header 
					that also needs to be soldered to the circuit board before use.</p>

					<p class="bem">Large breadboard</p>
					<p>I used a <a href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/advanced-solderless-breadboard-2002">Maplin 
					Breadboard AD-01</a> for the project as I had one to hand, but any similar breadboard 
					would do. You will also need a large number of inter-connect wires of different colours 
					for connecting the various components which can either be bought or made yourself from 
					some solid core wire.</p>
