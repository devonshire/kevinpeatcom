					<p>I have kept the code driving the robot fairly simple at this stage, it moves 
					forward and if it senses an obstacle it turns randomly to the left or right.</p>
					<p>The ultrasonic sensor is good at recognising large objects such as pieces of 
					furniture but smaller or more irregularly shaped objects can go unseen. Also, 
					just plugging the sensor into the breadboard means it isn't that stable and 
					occasionally needs adjusting. I plan to create a proper mount for it at some 
					stage to resolve this.</p>
					<p>I have adjusted the infra-red sensors to look for objects on the ground at 
					very short range. This works okay most of the time. Infra-red sensors have their 
					limitations, not working well in direct sunlight or failing to recognise objects 
					that poorly reflect infra-red light. At some stage I will get some more expensive 
					sensors to see if they work better.</p>
					<p>This <a href="http://www.societyofrobots.com/member_tutorials/node/71">article</a> 
					does a good job at comparing the relative merits of infra-red and ultrasonic sensors.</p>
					<p>Adding hardware bump sensors would also be a good idea so that where the other sensors 
					fail the robot doesn't plough on regardless potentially damaging itself and/or your 
					furniture.</p>
					<p>The current program just uses the accelerometer to sense if the robot has tipped over 
					and then cuts the power. The accelerometer could also be used to sense gradual changes in 
					gradient and to back away from potential problems. It could also be used to sense if the 
					robot has stalled and to cut the power before any damage is done to the motors.</p>
					<p>For the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor I used the 
					<a href="http://code.google.com/p/arduino-new-ping/">NewPing</a> library and for the 
					MMA7361 3-axis Accelerometer I used the 
					<a href="http://code.google.com/p/mma7361-library/">AcceleroMMA7361</a> library. You need 
					to download those libraries and install them in the &ldquo;libraries&rdquo; directory 
					within your Arduino development environment installation.</p>

					<p>The sketch is available to download from 
					<a href="http://github.com/devonshire/arduino-simple-robot">Github</a>. See the 
					<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage">Arduino Getting Started</a> pages 
					if you are new to Arduino.</p>
