					<p>Before buying anything I spent a good couple of months reading the forums on 
					<a href="http://www.mycncuk.com">MYCNCUK</a> and absorbing some of their 
					knowledge, so thanks goes to the contributors there.</p>

					<p>One of the first things to decide is what type of materials you will be milling. In my 
					case that would be mainly softwoods, plastics and small aluminium parts for robotics and RC 
					projects. There are many types of CNC mill but I decided to go with a gantry style design 
					mainly because it looked like something I could build but also because it should be suitable 
					for milling these materials.</p>

					<p>I decided to go with an A3 sized work area as that should be large enough for most 
					things that I would like to make. Also, if the work area was made much larger I would 
					need to use dual ballscrews (or some other mechanism) for the long axis to avoid potential 
					crabbing issues, incurring additional cost and increasing complexity. This really determined 
					the size of the whole machine.</p>

					<p>I used 10mm aluminium plate for the Y-axis and Z-axis for strength. For the remainder of the 
					machine I chose 50mm x 50mm and 30mm x 15mm aluminium box section which I already had available 
					so was cheap. In the future, I might make aluminium plate sides for the gantry if the box 
					section ones prove too flexible.</p>

					<p>After some research, I bought three of the 425oz Nema 23 stepper motors as these should be 
					more than powerful enough for my requirements. These were matched with three M542 stepper drivers 
					and a 36V PSU to drive them which fitted my budget. I also bought one of the cheap 5-axis parallel 
					port breakout boards (BoB) from Ebay.</p>

					<p>For a spindle, I decided to buy one of the 2.2KW water-cooled Chinese spindles and matching 
					VFD. The spindles themselves seem to have a good reputation although the VFD electronics can 
					apparently be flaky. These spindles accept ER20 collets which allows a flexible use of cheaper 
					woodworking router bits.</p>

					<p>I decided to go with supported linear rails as the additional cost did not seem to be that great 
					considering the added strength. I bought a set of already machined 1605 ballscrews, bearings, 
					ballnut housings and supported linear rails from this Chinese 
					<a href="http://www.auctiva.com/stores/viewstore2.aspx?id=1457656&styleid=12">supplier</a>. 
					Unfortunately, it seems that this type of thing is not available economically from a UK supplier. 
					They were delivered quickly and with reasonable customs charges and seem to be good quality parts 
					although again YMMV.</p>

					<p>My original design document from Sketchup is available <a href="cnc_build/design.skp">here</a>. 
					I made a few design changes during the build but nothing significant.</p>
