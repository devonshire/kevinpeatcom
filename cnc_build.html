					<p>This is the build log for my DIY CNC mill. It is not intended as a set of instructions to be 
					followed directly although hopefully there is some useful information here for anyone 
					interested in getting into the world of CNC and who wants to build their own machine.</p>

					<p>You don't really need any special skills or particularly expensive tools for this project. 
					A pillar drill (can be a pretty basic model) seems essential for accurate drilling of the metal 
					parts and a saw that can cut aluminium is also required. I used a cheap mitre saw with a standard 
					carbide blade which worked well. Accurate measurement is also important so a digital vernier caliper 
					will prove very useful.</p>

					<p>Basic electricians tools are also needed for wiring the various components as well as a large dose of 
					common sense when dealing with mains voltage AC power. If you are going to use allen bolts then it 
					is well worth investing in a really good set of allen keys to avoid skinned knuckles.</p>

					<p>Five minutes spent on CNC forums will demonstrate to you that the best tool for building a CNC 
					mill is another CNC mill. If you are lucky enough to have access to one of these machines then you 
					can save yourself a fair bit of time and effort in the build process.</p>

					<p>Good luck with your project.</p>
