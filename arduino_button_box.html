					<p class="bem">Arduino USB Button Box</p>

					<p>As an iRacing beginner I quickly got bored with trying to find and press 
					a particular key on the keyboard during a race which usually results in me crashing. 
					To help with this I thought I would put together an Arduino based button 
					box where the buttons should hopefully fall more easily to hand.</p>

					<p>As with some of my other projects, I chose to use an Arduino Leonardo due to 
					the built-in USB Human Interface Device (HID) capabilities. I bought a plastic 
					enclosure and some cheap buttons from Ebay which aren't brilliant so my recommendation 
					is to buy better quality buttons. I used a bracket taken from an old wheel to mount 
					the box to my desk.</p>
					
					<p>Wiring a button matrix can get quite complicated especially if you need to handle 
					multiple button presses at the same time. Fortunately, for this application, I only 
					need to press one button at a time. Therefore I decided to use a simple multiplexing 
					approach as described by Dan Nixon in his 
					<a href="http://www.dan-nixon.com/2012/04/multiplexing-switches-on-arduino.html">blog</a>. 
					This approach does not require any diodes or additional IC's.</p> 

					<p>See how this is wired on the Fritzing circuit diagram to the right. You will probably 
					need to modify the Arduino sketch to send the button presses that your application is 
					expecting. In the sketch I have included a list of the codes that need to be sent to 
					simulate various button presses.</p>

					<p>I am currently experimenting with using different buttons for different game 
					functions so hence the temporary labels which I will replace with something more 
					permanent in due course</p>

					<p>My Arduino sketch is available to download from 
					<a href="https://github.com/devonshire/arduino-button-box">GitHub</a>. See the 
					<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage">Arduino Getting Started</a> pages 
					if you are new to Arduino.</p></p>
