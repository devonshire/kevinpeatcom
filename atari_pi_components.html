					<p class="bem">Components Used</p>
					<p><ul>
					<li><strong>Atari ST</strong><br>Among my collection of Atari hardware I had a non-working 
					520STFM that I had purchased some time ago meaning to repair it. The case was in very good 
					condition not being faded as some ST's can be and with a good complete keyboard with all 
					keys working so I decided to use it for this project. Please DON'T use working machines 
					for this kind of project.</li>
					
					<li><strong>Raspberry Pi</strong><br>I used an original 256MB Model 'B' Pi as I had one to 
					hand but as I don't plan to use the ethernet connection, beyond loading some initial packages, a 
					model 'A' would also have worked. I used a 4GB SD card for the OS.</li>

					<li><strong>Arduino Leonardo</strong><br>The Arduino is used to interface between the 
					Atari ST keyboard and the Pi. The Leonardo is able to act directly as a USB keyboard controller 
					so makes this much easier to do. I did originally try to use an Arduino Uno which can also act as 
					a USB keyboard by re-writing the firmware with a custom version. Unfortunately, this didn't work 
					as the Uno shares its hardware serial port with the USB connection and the Atari keyboard would 
					not work correctly with a software serial port. I also considered connecting the ST keyboard 
					directly to the Pi but wasn't confident that I could get it working that way.</li>

					<li><strong>USB Hub</strong><br>To avoid multiple mains plugs being required I wanted 
					to power everything including the Pi from a powered USB hub. To enable that I brought a 
					powered hub on Ebay which came with a 2A power supply which should be more than enough.</li>

					<li><strong>USB Speaker</strong><br>Mostly I will be using the Atari with a monitor that doesn't 
					have any speakers built-in so I wanted to include a small speaker in the case. I also read that 
					the Raspberry Pi headphone jack doesn't work very well so I brought a small speaker on Ebay that 
					would fit in the case and also required only a USB connection for power and audio. If you were 
					going to make one of these to use with a TV then an internal speaker wouldn't be required.</li>

					<li><strong>USB Mouse</strong><br>I used a Microsoft Compact mouse that I already owned which 
					was coincidentally a similar colour scheme to the Atari itself. With some software changes it 
					would be possible to use an original Atari mouse but I much prefer the feel of a modern mouse.</li>

					<li><strong>USB/HDMI Cables</strong><br>A number of USB leads are required depending on the 
					hardware you are intending to use.</li>
					</ul></p>

					<p>The Atari cases are easy to strip and clean-up. To open and remove everything from the case 
					you just need a small cross-headed screwdriver. Be careful when cleaning the case as some of the 
					small plastic parts can be brittle.</p>
