					<p>I used G27 pedals with the Nixim brake mod for a number of years and although 
					they work well I wanted some top mounted GT style pedals to hopefully get a better feeling 
					of immersion so I decided to make my own.</p>
					
					<p>For the main structure, I used 50mm x 50mm and 30mm x 15mm aluminium box section and 
					10mm stainless steel rod to hold it all together. I produced a basic CAD design and g-code 
					files for CNC which are available 
					<a href="http://www.kevinpeat.com/pedals/design/?C=N;O=A">here</a> although they could just 
					as easily have been cut and drilled by hand.</p>
					
					<p>For the electronics, I used the <a href="http://www.leobodnar.com/shop/">Leo Bodnar</a> 
					BU0836-LC Load Cell Joystick Controller which has a single load cell interface and multiple 
					inputs for analogue devices (eg. potentiometers and hall sensors) and digital inputs for 
					buttons and switches.</p>
										
					<p>The load cell I used for the brake is a 0-30kg model bought from China which results in a 
					fairly light pedal so I may swap that for a higher rated model in the future. The model 
					I have is a Shenlen SL602 which is wired as WHITE = +5V, RED = -IN, YELLOW = +IN and BLACK = GND.</p>

					<p>For the clutch and accelerator I initially used A1302 Hall Sensors which are contactless and in 
					theory should maintain a smooth operation over the long-term.</p>
										
					<p><i>Update</i>: For unknown reasons I had trouble getting the hall sensor on the accelerator 
					to stay properly calibrated between sessions so I decided to replace it with a potentiometer 
					(ALPS 10k RK09711110K) and a traditional linkage which is working great so far.</p>

					<p>Choosing springs was mostly trial and error. I ended up with the brake spring being 
					27mm (OD) x 83mm x 5mm and the clutch as 17.5mm (OD) x 90mm x 2.8mm. I am still testing some 
					different accelerator springs. The one I am currently using is approximately 12.5mm (OD) x 80mm x 1mm. 
					My advice is just to buy a few springs so you can test how the pedals feel with different strengths.</p>
										
					<p>The pedals are fully adjustable for separation, reach and stroke but as I always left-foot 
					brake in games I spaced them fairly equally although it would be straightforward to set them 
					for heel-and-toe operation.</p>
	
					<p>I don't think these pedals will make me any quicker but they do feel a lot more like 
					driving a real car than my G27's so are good for improving immersion.</p>
